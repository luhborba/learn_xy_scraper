# Learn X in Y Web Scraper

Node.js script to scrape the pages from [Learn X in Y
Minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com). Either downloads the files if it exists
or scrapes the relevant content from the page.


## Notes

Ruby and PHP files link to Portuguese(?) and Korean versions respectively. So
edge cases can be added to prefer scraping page content over downloading the
file.

For content scraped pages, you can add an optional file extension as the scraped
content will default to saving to a file named after the language without
extensions.
